## Data
"Meta-analysis_Dataset.xlsx" includes studies compiled from the literature search described in the manuscript. Metrics and search methods are defined in the Materials and Methods section. Data were obtained from the original study or Birds of the World species accounts. Cells with "NR" indicate metrics were Not Reported in the orginal study. Species accounts referenced for each species are outlined in the Supplemental Materials.

## Code
"Meta-analyses_Jan2026.R" includes code for analyses and figures included in the manuscript. 

## Trees
Several phylogenetic trees were used in the analyses, reflecting different time scales in the response/reproductive variables. 


"all_spp_quant_analyses.nex" includes 1,000 phylogenetic trees for all species included in the quantitaive analyses (meta-analyses and vote counting analyses).


"all_spp.nex" includes 1,000 phylogenetic trees for all species included in the meta-analyses.


"daily_1000trees.nex" includes 1,000 phylogentic trees included for all species with the meta-analyses for daily reproductive metrics, such as daily nest survival.


"nest_1000trees.nex" includes 1,000 phylogentic trees included for all species with the meta-analyses for nest-level reproductive metrics, such as nest success.
